# Program 1 - Subset Sum

We all know the famous dynamic programming problem Subset Sum. This programming assignment aims to find the optimal subset which equals to the given sum in polynomial time.


to compile the python program run this on the command line
python main_opt.py <filename.txt> sum


example
python main_opt.py electoral.txt 269



# Program 2 - Dual parametered Dijkstra
Dijkstras algorithm with 2 constraints.
Usually we know the use case of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a single source using distance (Edge weights). But this algorithm uses Dijkstras to find the single source shortest path using distance and time as two parameters.
