#Dual parametered Dijkstra
Dijkstras algorithm with 2 constraints.
Usually we know the use case of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a single source using distance (Edge weights). But this algorithm uses Dijkstras to find the single source shortest path using distance and time as two parameters.
